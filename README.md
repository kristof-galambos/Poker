# Poker
You have 2 cards in your hand and 5 shared cards in front of you. What are the probabilities of each poker combination?

If you just want to know the answer, run "main.exe" and it will print the result to the console.

This code randomly picks 7 cards from a deck of french playing cards and then checks what combination he got. Repeat many times, and then you have the probability of each combination.
